# Project LCS: Your Open Source AI Agent

[한국어](README-ko.md)

**LCS** is an open-source AI agent designed to work with ChatGPT.

---

## Why Choose LCS?

1. **Easy to Extend**: Developers can easily add new features.
2. **Easy to Improve AI**: Customization are straightforward via prompt engineering.
3. **Open Source**: Freely accessible to everyone!

---

## How Does It Work?

1. When a user enters a prompt, LCS sends it to ChatGPT along with existing functions.
2. ChatGPT generates the corresponding Lua code to execute the prompt.
3. LCS executes the function generated by ChatGPT.

---

### What Makes LCS Better Than Other AI Agents?

- **Daemon Support**: LCS can create persistent background tasks. For example:  
  `If I arrive at home, disable Do Not Disturb mode.`
- **High Extensibility**: Developers can implement new features effortlessly by annotating objects
  and providing descriptions in JavaDoc format.

## UI

I’m not satisfied with the current UI/UX of this app. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open
an issue. Let’s discuss your ideas together!

---

## TODO

- Add more functionalities.
- Integrate microphone input (similar to Siri or Bixby).
- Implement Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to make the app more extendable (planning to use AIDL
  for this).

If you submit a PR related to these tasks, I’ll be thrilled!
